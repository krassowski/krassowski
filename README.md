Pragmatically this situation also affects my ability to contribute to open source; in my 🇵🇱 hometown every 10th person is now a 🇺🇦 refugee, everyone is organising aid and praying for the quick end of Putin's aggression. The wounds of Soviet occupation are reopening, still fresh in the memory of our grandparents. The fear of the conflict [spilling](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-59582146) [over](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/08/how-will-russias-war-with-ukraine-end-here-are-5-possible-outcomes.html) may sound irrational to you, but history and geopolitics tell us it is more likely than you imagine. The fact is, it is already paralyzing neighbouring countries and without more of your help they may not be able to contain it, let alone sleep at night knowing of the horrors of war just behind the corner, or engage in pastimes like open-source contributions.

### Why so many Polish organisations on the list?

- Poland recieved the most refugees of all neighbouring countries ([1.5 million as of 13 March](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/andrzej-duda-polish-homes-romania-europe-b2034809.html), about a half of the total 3 million),
- while you can do your own research in the Anglosphere; I am offering a list of tripple-checked suggestions for fundraisers which offer better bang for your buck or may be less prominently advertised or not easily discoverable from English sources,
- most supplies are [routed through](https://razomforukraine.org/38-tons-on-the-way/) or [bought in](https://razomforukraine.org/supplies-from-poland/) Poland either way; buying locally is simply cheaper (lower transport cost, lower price to begin with),
- delivering material aid from certain countries, like the UK, is hindered by [logistical and legal problems](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/09/brexit-red-tape-stopping-small-charities-getting-supplies-to-ukraine).
